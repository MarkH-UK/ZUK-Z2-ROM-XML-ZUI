With Chinese phones more popular than ever, consumers are importing phones and are facing the big challenge of no localisation inside the core OS. At ZUKfans.eu we aim to change this by starting our own independent multi language ROM project.\r\n\r\n### Welcome ZUK FANS EUROPE MULTI LANGUAGE PROJECT\r\nCurrently there is a lot of editing work to do on the main repo, this will take several days to complete (written at 20th June 2016).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
